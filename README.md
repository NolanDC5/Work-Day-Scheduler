# Work-Day-Scheduler
Deployed URL: https://nolandc5.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

This application I created a scheduler/planner for the typical work day. The scheduler has 8 segments one for each hour 9-5.
The hours will show a different color depending on where it is in relation to your day. 
We have three different colors...
Grey for the past as its behind you no need to worry about it anymore.
Red for the current hour as it takes priortity for what needs to get done.
Green for the future as the future brings good thiungs to come.
